      <h2>Requirements of the S-CASE Requirements Annotation Tool</h2>
        <p>Although a tool is not necessarily released along with its user requirements, the
           S-CASE Requirements Annotation Tool is quite different. Since the tool is about annotating
           requirements itself, we decided to publish the requirements as a potential example of using
           the tool (recursion at its finest <big>&#9786;</big>).
        </p>
        <p>This document contains the user requirements for the tool, both functional and non-functional,
           as well as a typical user scenario which is provided in order to help you understand the
           functionality of the S-CASE Requirements Annotation Tool. 
        </p>
      <h3>User Requirements</h3>
      <h4>Functional Requirements</h4>
        <p>
             The user must be able to create a new project by adding the project name and the project requirements.<br/>
             The user must be able to import a project by importing its requirements and optionally any existing annotations.<br/>
             The user must be able to create a new folder in his/her collection.<br/>
             The user must be able to delete any folder or project in his/her collection.<br/>
             The user must be able to annotate single or multiple terms as an entity.<br/>
             The user must be able to create associations between the annotated entities.<br/>
             The user must be able to delete any entity or association annotations.<br/>
             The user must be able to modify any entity or association annotations.<br/>
             The system must allow the user to view, modify and delete only his/her annotations.<br/>
             The administrator must be able to view and modify all annotations of all users.<br/>
             The user must be able to export any project in his/her collection and export also the annotations.<br/>
        </p>
      <h4>Non-Functional Requirements</h4>
        <p>
             The system must support importing and exporting the annotations in &quot;ann&quot; form.<br/>
             The system must allow the administrator to export the annotations in &quot;owl&quot; and &quot;ttl&quot; forms as well.<br/>
             The automatic annotation component must annotate any requirement within less than a second.<br/>
             The system should warn the user whenever a delete operation is performed on annotations or projects.<br/>
             The user interface of the tool must be intuitive and user-friendly.<br/>
             The user interface must not allow the user to input non-valid annotations.<br/>
        </p>
      <h3>User Scenario</h3>
        <p>
           John is the Head of an R&amp;D team working on Automated Software Engineering. Lately, the team has
           been working on the development of search engine for Software projects, and John realized that, in
           order to perform basic tests, he is going to need annotated user requirements from past projects.
           That's OK -he thinks- since his group has developed a number of projects following a standard software
           engineering (SE) process, thus writing down user requirements. However, these requirements are not
           annotated, so he assigns the annotation task to Bill. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Bill is a keen junior researcher who has used SE tools in the past and has heard of the S-CASE Requirements
           Annotation Tool. He follows the related URL, registers and is presented with a simple interface where he
           can import and annotate the software projects. Foe each project, he creates a .txt file with the set of
           functional requirements and uploads them to the tool. After inserting the requirements, Bill has to start
           annotating them. The tool provides Bill with functionality like double-clicking on terms to set an annotation
           and dragging entities to form associations, which is very intuitive. However, annotating all the requirements
           for all the project will take Bill a lot of time. He wished the annotation task could be done semi-automatically.
           Then, he notices the auto-annotation feature of the S-CASE Requirements Annotation Tool. A coarse annotation is
           performed by the system and Bill reviews and edits what needs to be corrected. More than half of the annotations
           that he wants to perform are already created. After minor corrections, he is able to annotate a whole project in
           a few minutes! 
        </p>
        <p>
           Furthermore, since the tool supports different user accounts, he gives the address also to his partners, Bob and
           Mary, and asks them whether they could help with annotating the projects. Bob and Mary agree to help. Bill, being
           the administrator of the group, is able to download the annotations of all projects in .ann, .owl and .ttl format.
           He gives them to John who is pleasantly surprised by the quality of the annotations and can use them as a base to
           start building tests.
