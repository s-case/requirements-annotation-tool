      <h2>Welcome to the S-CASE Requirements Annotation Tool!</h2>
        <!--p align="right" style="font-size:80%;"><i>This tool is largely based on the brat annotation tool, 
          available <a href="http://brat.nlplab.org/">here</a>.</i>
        </p>-->
        <p>Supported browsers are Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet
          Explorer. Firefox, however, is highly recommended.
        </p>
      <h3>Main Menu</h3>
      <img src="static/img/manual/first_screen.png" alt="first screen" title="Main Menu" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
        <p>The menu of the application is placed on top of the window. The buttons of
          the menu are:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Register:</b> Register for creating an account</li>
            <li><b>Login:</b> Log in for accessing and/or editing the collection</li>
            <li><b>Collection:</b> Opens the collection browser (to create, edit
            and delete the files of the user)</li>
            <li><b>Export:</b> Contains controls for exporting the text files and the
            annotations</li>
            <li><b>Auto-Annotate:</b> Executes an automatic annotator on the existing
            document</li>
            <li><b>Help:</b> Opens a help window</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      <h3>User Accounts</h3>
        <p>Every user of the system has his/her own collection of documents.
          The system has no multi-user support in the sense that no more than
          one user can edit a document. In fact, each user can only create and
          edit/annotate documents in his/her own collection. Upon registering,
          the system creates a collection for the user, which can be accessed
          if he/she is logged in to the system.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="static/img/manual/register.png" alt="register" title="Register Form" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>
        <img src="static/img/manual/login.png" alt="login" title="Login Form"/>
        </div>
        <h4>Registering</h4>
        <p>Registering for an account is easy. Simply push the register button and fill
          in the form with your desired username and password. If the username exists,
          the system will prompt you to select a different one.
        </p>
        <h4>Logging in</h4>
        <p>If you have a username and a password, you can login to the system by entering
          them in the login form.
        </p>
      <h3>Collections and Documents</h3>
        <p>The collection of the user is actually the uppermost folder that
          he/she can access. The &quot;Collection&quot; button on the left of the menu is
          used to open the collection at any time. In this folder, the user can
          create documents and folders using the respective buttons or access
          them by double-clicking on them. Additionally, the user can delete a
          folder or a document using the respective buttons.
        </p>
        <img src="static/img/manual/collection.png" alt="collection" title="Collection" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
        <p>The user can insert a new project by pressing the &quot;Create new project&quot;
          and inputting the project name and the requirements in the dedicated text fields.
          Furthermore, he/she can import a project with or without annotations upon pressing
          the  &quot;Import a project&quot; button. The &quot;Document&quot; field is required
          but the &quot;Annotations&quot; field is optional.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="static/img/manual/create_project.png" alt="create_project" title="Create Project Form" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>
        <img src="static/img/manual/import_project.png" alt="import_project" title="Import Project Form" style="padding-bottom: 50px;"/>
        </div>
      <h3>Document Annotation</h3>
        <p>Upon having created (or imported) a document, double-clicking on it opens it in
          the main visualization area. Then the user can place different annotations on the
          document. In specific, the tool supports the following types of annotations:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Entities:</b> Declare the type of each term (or consecutive
            terms). They are added by selecting the term(s) or double-clicking
            on a term.</li>
            <li><b>Associations:</b> Declare the relations between different
            entities. They are added by &quot;dragging&quot; the annotation
            of an entity on another annotation.</li>
          </ul>
          Existing annotations can be modified or deleted by double-clicking
          on them. Note that the associations can only be added after the entities.
          Furthermore, only supported associations can be added.
        </p>
        <h4>Automatic Annotation</h4>
        <p>
          When the user has opened a project in the main area, he/she can perform automatic
          annotation on the project. <b>Note that automatic annotation should be used only
          as a helpful complement. No guarantee is provided as to the quality of the
          annotations. As a result, the user has to review the annotations and add any missing
          ones.</b>
        </p>
        <img src="static/img/manual/annotated.png" alt="annotated" title="Auto-Annotation example (and reviewing the annotations)" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
        <h4>Exporting Annotated projects</h4>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, the user should refine the annotations provided by the automatic
          annotator. After that, there is no need to save any of the annotations. The system
          automatically saves any annotation the users perform, thus it is perfectly safe.
        </p>
        <img src="static/img/manual/annotatedfinal.png" alt="annotatedfinal" title="Finished Annotation example" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
        <p>
          Exporting an annotated project is done by pressing the &quot;Export&quot; button. Then the
          user is presented with two options relevant to exporting the txt and the ann of the project.
          The &quot;txt&quot; option simply exports the requirements of the project in text form. The &quot;txt&quot;
          option exports an ann file containing the annotations of the project.
        </p>
        <img src="static/img/manual/export_project.png" alt="export_project" title="Exporting Project Annotations" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
        <p>
          Although your projects are perfectly safe on the server, it is recommended to also export them in
          txt and ann form in order to have a local copy of them. Importing a project is done as explained above
          using the import form. Note that you have to import both the txt and the ann file at the same time. In
          addition, during import, there should be no conflicts with other projects so you should use a project name
          that does not already exist in your collection.
